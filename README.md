Mod 2 Intermission Practice

This is a simple demonstration of using fetch to implement get, post, and delete requests on a local server. This is designed to be used in conjuction with [this](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/network-request-exercises) set up repository. Follow the installation instructions on that repository to get the local server up and running. From there, you can clone and install this repo to see the demonstration of get, post, and delete in action with a very simplistic, demonstration-intended UI.
